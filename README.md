# Fluid Properties Calculator

## Project Overview
This project is a console-based C++ application designed to calculate various fluid properties, including velocity, density, pressure, and temperature for different fluids such as water, oil, methanol, and air. The program uses fundamental physics formulas and provides a simple graphical interface using console functions. The objective of our mini project is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem.

## Features
- **Velocity Calculation:** Uses the formula \( V = \frac{Q}{A} \) to determine the velocity of a fluid given its flow rate and pipe diameter.
- **Density Calculation:** Computes fluid density based on mass and volume.
- **Pressure & Temperature Estimations:** Includes methods for estimating these properties for different fluids.
- **Basic Console UI:** Uses `gotoxy()` for text positioning and `SetColor()` for color-coded outputs.

## Technologies Used
- C++
- Windows API for console manipulation
- Standard I/O functions for user input

## How to Run
1. Compile the code using a C++ compiler (Dev C++).
2. Run the executable file in a Windows command prompt.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to input values and get results.

## Future Improvements
- Enhance the UI with a better graphical representation.
- Extend the program to support more complex fluid dynamics calculations.
- Add a file-saving feature to log results for future reference.

## Author
Developed as a final project for a Computer Programming course in 2020.
